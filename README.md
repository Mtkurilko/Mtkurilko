# 👋 Hey, I’m Michael  

I’m a 19-year-old student who’s into **art, computer science, music, writing, cooking, and games**.  
Basically, if it involves creating something — I’m probably messing around with it.  

I’m also the **founder and owner of Mythron LLC**, a software development company that’s on the edge of publishing its first software/app solutions.

### 🔧 What I’m Into
- Coding projects (Python, JS, Java, and learning C++)  
- Biggest JS fan (from vanilla to React Native)  
- Random project dev + creative coding  
- Writing (yes, books *and* code — storytelling in different formats)  
- Experimenting in the kitchen (I like to think I'm a good cook)  
- Mixing music + tech 

---

### 🛠️ Current Focus
- Launching the first solutions from **Mythron LLC**  
- Building small projects that actually *solve problems* (or at least make life easier)  
- Exploring game dev as a way to blend coding + creativity  
- Improving my skills in React Native & full-stack development  
- Finding ways to connect my love for art, writing, and code into something bigger
